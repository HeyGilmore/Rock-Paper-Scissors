- The user will arrive at webpage and see a title and button that says starts
- Once the button is pushed, both button a nd title will disappear
- a help statement will appear with a button to continue.
- Once continued, a statement will appear (Choose your fate) and three icons will appear for rock paper scissors. 
- Once clicked, all disappear and keeps the one you clicked, 
- count down from three 
- Boom, a title stating winner/loser, little message of what happen rock beats scissors, play again button

- Clear that history if needed.
