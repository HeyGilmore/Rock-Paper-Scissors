The Process
</h2>

- The user will arrive at webpage and see a title and button that says starts
- Once the button is pushed, both button and title will fade out.
- <s>a help statement will appear with a button to continue. </s>
- Once continued, a statement will appear (Choose your fate) and three icons will appear for rock paper scissors.
- Once clicked, all disappear and keeps the one you clicked,
- count down from three
- Boom, a title stating winner/loser, little message of what happen rock beats scissors, play again button

* <strong>Bonus Idea:</strong>
  - Use local storage to save the history of the game.
  - Clear history if needed.
